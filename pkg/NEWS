NEWS/Change log file

Version 0.2.0 (2009-12-14)
 
 o  Upgraded to Google gdata version 1.40.  This had a
 gdata-docs-3.0.jar, up from gdata-docs-2.0.jar.  I had to change a
 bunch of minor things.  See below.

 o  Added argument 'sheetIndex' to 'downloadDocument' so you can
 download a specific sheet.  Works only for csv and tsv format (at the
 request of Farrel Buchinski).   

 o  Had to change some http calls on the java side.  Noticed that the
 document Id is now different than the spreadsheet Id that you get if
 you use the spreadsheets API.  This forced me to introduce another
 slot into the SpreadsheetEntry object called spreadsheetId.  I'm
 using this Id when I add/delete worksheets.
 
 o  When working with worksheets, I now construct directly the
 worksheetFeedUrl.  This should be marginally faster. 

 o  Improved the unit tests.  


Version 0.0.10 (2009-08-27)

 o First release on R-Forge
 o Importing files does not work.
